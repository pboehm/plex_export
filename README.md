# plex_export

`plex_export.rb` allows you to export Series from your Plex Media Server into a
`.m3u` file (used for playlists). This playlist can then be used everywhere,
where Plex is not supported natively.

## Installation

```
$ git clone https://github.com/pboehm/plex_export.git
$ cd plex_export
$ bundle install
```

## Exporting

```
$ PLEX_HOST=1.2.3.4 PLEX_TOKEN=ABCDEFEDEDEDED bundle exec ./plex_export.rb "Simpsons"
#EXTM3U
#EXTINF:-1,S01E01 - Es weihnachtet schwer.avi
http://1.2.3.4:32400/library/parts/85/file.avi?X-Plex-Token=ABCDEFEDEDEDED
....
```

### Extract the PLEX_TOKEN

For remote access to your Plex Media Server, a special token for authentication
ist required. Go to the Plex Web UI and choose some episode, look for the
Download Action and extract the Token value from the corresponding url (The
value after `X-Plex-Token=`).
